Syntax and conventions are very important when dealing
with scripting. When you are creating names for objects in
your scripts it helps others see what is is and easily
identify. For example, using pascal caseing when you create
a class or camel casing when declaring a variable or all
caps for a constant. Indenting your code, although not always
required, is a great way to keep blocks of code organized and
easily readable. Using comments when you are writing your
code helps to identify what each block of code is doing.
to create comments you simply type two formard slashes. Another
helpful way to keep things looking good and free from errors
is avoiding using literal numbers. When you create a variable
its best to assign it a value then use the variable name to call
back to that value.
